Supernova is a Minecraft Server Player Database.
By using Supernova, you can easily query players' in-game information, and build related websites.
By default, in-game information contains the following data:
 - Players' online time;
 - Players' first join time;
 - Players' advancements.
Supernova also supports plugins, designed for Minecraft mod/plugin support.
 - However, in order to store mod/plugin data in Supernova database, you need to modify the mod/plugin
   or inject code into them.
